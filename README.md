   # The Curriculum for Everything
Is a curated list of the way to start learning everything.


<h1>Foreward</h1>

<p>The idea for this list was spawned by projects like the <a href = 'https://github.com/ossu/computer-science'>The Open Source Society University</a>, <a href = 'https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome'>The Awesome list</a> and <a href = 'https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy'>The Awesome Piracy list.</a>
     What do those have in common you ask? Well all of these lists provide a way for you to start, whether you are searching for a technology,
     how to download a certain movie or learn CS all of these lists basically make you more informed. They each provide you a great way of learning and getting started with something.
     But there is a lack of these lists for other things like musical instruments, 3D design like Blender and other skills like drawing.
     <strong>There are plenty of free resources they are just a bit difficult to find and to know what order to take them in. It's also hard to tell where to go after finishing a certain tutorial.</strong> So I want to create a list for numerous different things that are general curriculumns to follow. For example, I want to learn piano and there are tons of videos and tutorials online but I don't know where to start. Do I learn notes, chords or scales? Either way I start I will probably be fine but this analysis paralysis can lead to me switching to different videos and not really learning everything. Or once I finish, where do I go next to learn more after finishing that tutorial? This list aims to help with that.</p>


<br><br/>
<h1>TLDR:</h1>
<p>Most free programming tutorials have great curriculums to tell you where to go and what to learn next. 
    There is a lack of that for nontechnical skills. This list is an attempt to create a simple curriculum for a large 
    variety of skills that links to videos or tutorials that you can easily follow to learn</p>
    <strong>There are plenty of free resources they are just a bit difficult to find and to know what order to take them in</strong>

<h1>Example</h1>
<p>For example lets say we want to teach someone modern web development. First we start with

<ul>
  <li>Learning Basic HTML</li>
  Then we would direct them to a couple links that would help with learning that like:
  <i><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE">Free Code Camp's HTML Youtube course</a></i>,  <i><a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-responsive-web-design-by-building-a-piano">
    The Beginning part of FreeCodeCamp's HTML course </a></i>, or 
    <i><a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/">The HTML part of the ODIN Project's course</a></i> 
   
 <li>Learn CSS</li>
 Then you would tell one that they need to learn CSS and you would give them resources on how to do that as well. So on and so on. 


   
</ul>

<br>
<p>As I said before the roadmap for webdev is mostly already worked out by sites like The Odin Project and Free Code FreeCodeCamp. They give you a pretty strict outline of what to do.
    But for things like learning Blender, Guitar or Piano, it is hard for novices to tell what they need to learn next and where to go to obtain that knowledge.
